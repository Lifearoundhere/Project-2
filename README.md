## Installation

Clone or download the repo

Open folder in the terminal and run ```npm install``` 

## Overview

The brief was to build a React application that consumes a public API While pair coding with the partner. We ended up using two public APIs, one was reed.co.uk, and the other was Eventbrite. The concept of our application was to be an aggregator of jobs and job-related networking events.

## Process

We started by listing Concepts that we thought were interesting and then loving APIs that we thought would be able to handle our requests. After filtering out the APIs which we deemed not suitable due to:

- Issues relating to prerequisite applications to get API key, 
- Inconsistent data and API’s that had limited data sets.

We finally settled on Reed.co.uk and Eventbrite


## Challenges

The biggest challenge was merging the two datasets from each API together. As each API had it had its structure, we had to marry the together; by extracting indexes that we needed.

## Wins

Given the small amount of time we had, I felt that we managed to get a lot done, and the final application was fairly decent/fully functional. 
if i did this again, I think I would have spent more time by building more UX focused features
